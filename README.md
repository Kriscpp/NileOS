# NILE OS

**Made by Epical Cheese Wizard**

NILE OS is a Linux-based operating system built for developers, creators, students, and everyday users who want a system that simply works—without ads, accounts, tracking, or gimmicks.

It combines a familiar, Windows-like desktop experience with the power, stability, and flexibility of Linux. NILE OS focuses on clarity, performance, and user control. Nothing communicates externally unless the user allows it. Nothing is hidden. Everything is reversible.
